# Python-Mediapipe-face-tracking-mouse-control
This project implements an assistive human computer interface with the help of face tracking.

Thanks to the python library Kivy soon there will be an installation file for platform independent Graphical User Interface.

Before this you will need the dependancies from the virtual enviroment to run the source code.
